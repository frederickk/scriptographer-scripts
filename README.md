Scriptographer-Scripts
------
A collection of scripts I've written for [Scriptographer](http://www.scriptographer.org/) over the years. Not every piece of code was created by me but credit and links are given where credit is due.

Some of the scripts I've documented/discussed in more detail on my [blog](http://blog.kennethfrederick.de/search/label/scriptographer).


- [scriptographer/paperjs. lissajous](http://blog.kennethfrederick.de/2013/01/scriptographerpaperjs-lissajous.html)

- [scriptographer. create grid](http://blog.kennethfrederick.de/2012/02/scriptographer-create-grid.html)

- [scriptographer. lorem ipsum](http://kenfrederick.blogspot.com/2011/06/scriptographer-lorem-ipsum.html)

- [scriptographer. push/pull points](http://kenfrederick.blogspot.com/2011/01/scriptographer-pushpull-points.html)

- [scriptographer. object/layer select](http://kenfrederick.blogspot.com/2009/06/scriptographer-objectlayer-select.html)


Also, be sure to look at the [Scriptographer](http://www.scriptographer.org/) version of my [Folio.js](github.com/frederickk/folio.js) library.
